<h1>Laser Counter</h1>
<h4>In this project we are using Arduino Uno to count the number of boxes passing through by reading changes in LDR voltage drop along its terminals.</h4>

<h6>the idea of the project is the change in light falling on the LDR, as when there is a box is passing it prevents Laser Beam from reaching the LDR and so the system could be able to trigger the motion of objects through the channel.</h6>
